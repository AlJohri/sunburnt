Sunburnt provides an interface for working with the Solr search engine.

Requirements:

  * httplib2
  * lxml

Strongly recommended

  * mx.DateTime

  Sunburnt will happily deal with dates stored either as Python datetime objects, or as mx.DateTime objects. The latter are preferable, having better semantics and a wider representation range. They will be used if present, otherwise sunburnt will fall back to Python datetime objects.

  * pytz

  Solr DateFields must be in UTC. If using native Python datetime objects, you should also have pytz installed to guarantee correct timezone handling.

Optional

  To run the tests, you'll also need:

  * nose
